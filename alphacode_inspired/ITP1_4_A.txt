CORRECT SOLUTION
Write a program which reads two integers $a$ and $b$, and calculates the following values:
  * $a / b$: $d$ (in integer)
  * remainder of $a / b$: $r$ (in integer)
  * $a / b$: $f$ (in real number)

Input

Two integers $a$ and $b$ are given in a line.

  * $1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9$

Output

Print $d$, $r$ and $f$ separated by a space in a line. For $f$, the output should not contain an absolute error greater than $10^{-5}$.

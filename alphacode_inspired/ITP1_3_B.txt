CORRECT SOLUTION
In the online judge system, a judge file may include multiple datasets to check whether the submitted program outputs a correct answer for each test case. This task is to practice solving a problem with multiple datasets.
Write a program which reads an integer $x$ and print it as is. Note that multiple datasets are given for this problem.

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of an integer $x$ in a line.
The input ends with an integer 0. You program should not process (print) for this terminal symbol.

  * $1 \leq x \leq 10000$
  * The number of datasets $\leq 10000$

Output

For each dataset, print $x$ in the following format:
Case i: x
where $i$ is the case number which starts with 1. Put a single space between "Case" and $i$. Also, put a single space between ':' and $x$.

Examples

Input


3
5
11
7
8
19
0


Output


Case 1: 3
Case 2: 5
Case 3: 11
Case 4: 7
Case 5: 8
Case 6: 19

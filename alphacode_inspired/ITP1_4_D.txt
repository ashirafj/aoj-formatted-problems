CORRECT SOLUTION
Write a program which reads a sequence of $n$ integers $a_i (i = 1, 2, ... n)$, and prints the minimum value, maximum value and sum of the sequence.

Input

In the first line, an integer $n$ is given. In the next line, $n$ integers $a_i$ are given in a line.

  * $0 < n \leq 10000$
  * $-1000000 \leq a_i \leq 1000000$

Output

Print the minimum value, maximum value and sum in a line. Put a single space between the values.

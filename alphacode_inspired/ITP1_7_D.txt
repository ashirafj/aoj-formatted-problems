CORRECT SOLUTION
Write a program which reads a $n \times m$ matrix $A$ and a $m \times l$ matrix $B$, and prints their product, a $n \times l$ matrix $C$. An element of matrix $C$ is obtained by the following formula:
$c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^m a_{ik}b_{kj}$
where $a_{ij}$, $b_{ij}$ and $c_{ij}$ are elements of $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively.

Input

In the first line, three integers $n$, $m$ and $l$ are given separated by space characters
In the following lines, the $n \times m$ matrix $A$ and the $m \times l$ matrix $B$ are given.

  * $1 \leq n, m, l \leq 100$
  * $0 \leq a_{ij}, b_{ij} \leq 10000$

Output

Print elements of the $n \times l$ matrix $C$ ($c_{ij}$). Print a single space character between adjacent elements.

Write a program which reads two integers $a$, $b$ and an operator $op$, and then prints the value of $a op b$.

The operator $op$ is '+', '-', '*' or '/' (sum, difference, product or quotient). The division should truncate any fractional part.

-----Input-----

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format.

$a op b$

The input ends with a dataset where $op$ = '?'. Your program should not process for this dataset.

$0 \leq a, b \leq 20000$

No divisions by zero are given.

-----Output-----

For each dataset, print the value in a line.

-----Example-----
Input
1 + 2
56 - 18
13 * 2
100 / 10
27 + 81
0 ? 0

Output
3
38
26

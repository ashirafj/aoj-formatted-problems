Write a program which reads two integers $x$ and $y$, and prints them in ascending order. 

-----Input-----

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of two integers $x$ and $y$ separated by a single space.

The input ends with two 0 (when both $x$ and $y$ are zero). Your program should not process for these terminal symbols.

$0 \leq x, y \leq 10000$

The number of datasets $\leq 3000$

-----Output-----

For each dataset, print $x$ and $y$ in ascending order in a line. Put a single space between $x$ and $y$.

-----Example-----
Input
3 2
2 2
5 3
0 0

Output
2 3
2 2
3 5

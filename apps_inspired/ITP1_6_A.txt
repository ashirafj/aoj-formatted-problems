Write a program which reads a sequence and prints it in the reverse order.

-----Input-----

The input is given in the following format:

$n$
$a_1$ $a_2$ . . . $a_n$

$n$ is the size of the sequence and $a_i$ is the $i$th element of the sequence.

$n \leq 100$

$0 \leq a_i < 1000$

-----Output-----

Print the reversed sequence in a line. Print a single space character between adjacent elements (Note that your program should not put a space character after the last element).

-----Example-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
5 4 3 2 1

Input
8
3 3 4 4 5 8 7 9

Output
9 7 8 5 4 4 3 3

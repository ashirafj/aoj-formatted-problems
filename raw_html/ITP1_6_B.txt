</p>

<p>
The 52 cards include 13 ranks of each of the four suits: spade, heart, club and diamond.
</p>

  In the first line, the number of cards <var>n</var> (<var>n</var> &le; 52) is given.
</p>

<p>
  In the following <var>n</var> lines, data of the <var>n</var> cards are given. Each card is given by a pair of a character and an integer which represent its suit and rank respectively. A suit is represented by 'S', 'H', 'C' and 'D' for spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds respectively. A rank is represented by an integer from 1 to 13.
</p>

<H2>Output</H2>

 Arrange the missing cards in the following priorities:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Print cards of spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds in this order.</li>
<li>If the suits are equal, print cards with lower ranks first.</li>
</ul>

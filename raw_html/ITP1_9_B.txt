<H1>Shuffle</H1><br>

<p>
  Your task is to shuffle a deck of <var>n</var> cards, each of which is marked by a alphabetical letter.
</p>

<p>
  A single shuffle action takes out <var>h</var> cards from the bottom of the deck and moves them to the top of the deck.
</p>

<p>
  The deck of cards is represented by a string as follows.
</p>

<pre>
abcdeefab
</pre>

<p>
  The first character and the last character correspond to the card located at the bottom of the deck and the card on the top of the deck respectively.
</p>

<p>
  For example, a shuffle with <var>h</var> = 4 to the above deck, moves the first 4 characters "abcd" to the end of the remaining characters "eefab", and generates the following deck:
</p>

<pre>
eefababcd
</pre>

<p>
  You can repeat such shuffle operations.
</p>

<p>
  Write a program which reads a deck (a string) and a sequence of <var>h</var>, and prints the final state (a string). 
</p>


<H2>Input</H2>

<p>
  The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format:
</p>

<pre>
A string which represents a deck
The number of shuffle <var>m</var>
<var>h</var><sub>1</sub>
<var>h</var><sub>2</sub>
  .
  .
<var>h</var><sub><var>m</var></sub>
</pre>

<p>
  The input ends with a single character '-' for the string.
</p>

<H2>Constraints</H2>

<ul>
<li>The length of the string &le; 200</li>
<li>1 &le; <var>m</var> &le; 100</li>
<li>1 &le; <var>h<sub>i</sub></var> &lt; The length of the string</li>
<li> The number of datasets &le; 10</li>
</ul>



<H2>Output</H2>

<p>
  For each dataset, print a string which represents the final state in a line.
</p>

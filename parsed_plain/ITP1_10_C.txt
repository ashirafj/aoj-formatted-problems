Standard Deviation

  You have final scores of an examination for n students. Calculate standard deviation of the scores s1, s2 ... sn.


The variance α2 is defined by  


α2  = (∑ni=1(si - m)2)/n


  where m is an average of si.

  The standard deviation of the scores is the square root of their variance.
  
Input

  The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format:


n
s1 s2 ... sn


  The input ends with single zero for n.

Output

  For each dataset, print the standard deviation in a line. The output should not contain an absolute error greater than 10-4.

Constraints

n ≤ 1000
0 ≤ si ≤ 100
